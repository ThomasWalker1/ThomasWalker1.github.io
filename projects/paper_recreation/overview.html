        Throughout the summer of 2024 I am exploring various machine learning papers, and implementing the tools that they develop. Doing so I am aiming to develop and intuition of the properties of machine learning models. Specifically, I am interested in implementing tools that elucidate the geometry of neural networks and give insights to what is going on in a neural network. The accompyning code for these posts can be found <a href="https://github.com/ThomasWalker1/expositions/tree/main">here.</a>
