        Using SplineCam we can investigate how the decision boundaries of neural networks evolve through training. Below are different neural network architectures trained on different datasets. The choice of architectures are made to investigate how the decision boundary of a neural network relates to its width and depth. Throughout, networks employ the ReLU activation function and are trained using the Adam optimizer, with learning rate 0.001, for 500 epochs.
