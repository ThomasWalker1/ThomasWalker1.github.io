        This project was inspired by <a href="https://timaeus.co/">Timaeus</a> who a progressing the field of developmental interpretability of neural networks using singular learning theory. I was motivated to investigation adversarial robustness after having insightful discussions with <a href="https://www.jessehoogland.com/">Jesse Hoogland</a>, and my previous interest in the connection between generalisation and robustness. This project was also supported by helpful conversations in the Developmental Interpretability Discord, most notably from Dr <a href="http://therisingsea.org/">Daniel Murfet</a>.
