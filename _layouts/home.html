          I am a graduate student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford, having graduated from Imperial College London with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics. I am interested in understanding the inner-workings of machine learning models, with a focus on methods leveraging geometrical and topological ideals. I intend to pursue this agenda through my master's and subsequent PhD.
        </p>

          Currently, I am exploring neural network generalisation and how models encode concepts. These topics intrigue me for they demystify models, which is stimulating from an intellectual perspective but is also significant for the reliable deployment of these models. I am motivated by to conduct machine learning research so that we can effectively harness the benefits of machine learning technology whilst limiting its risks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Broadly my academic interests include topology for machine learning, geometric deep learning, neural network generalisation, mechanistic interpretability, and an introduction to singular learning theory.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my spare time I enjoy pondering about philosophy and the theory of mind. Moreover, I participate in sports including running, cycling and swimming.
