        <p>
          I am an incoming PhD student at Rice University, under the supervision of <a href="https://richb.rice.edu/">Professor Richard Baraniuk</a>. I am interested in understanding the inner-workings of machine learning models with a focus on geometrical perspectives, such as the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04809">spline theory of deep learning</a>; with the intention of improving the reliability and robustness of machine learning models.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am exploring the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20174">tropical geometry of neural networks</a>, with <a>Dr Anthea Monod</a> at Imperial College London. Tropical geometry provides a formal representation of neural networks which can be leveraged to rigorously explore the geometry of neural networks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Broadly my research interests include understanding the geometry of machine learning models to help understand their properties, and lead to informed techniques for improving their reliability and deployment.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my spare time I enjoy pondering about philosophy and the theory of mind. Moreover, I participate in sports including running, cycling and swimming. Oh, and I also like to listen to podcasts...
        </p>
        <h3>Podcast Statistics</h3>
        <details>
          <summary>Gemini's summary of my interests from my most recent podcasts.</summary>
          <p>
            <h4>Dominant Themes</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML):</strong> This is by far your biggest interest. You are deeply exploring various aspects of AI, from the technical details (e.g., test-time inference, underutilized GPUs, topological ML, active inference) to the broader implications (e.g., AI safety, AI development, the future of AI, and AGI). You are clearly interested in the cutting edge of AI research and development.</li>
                <li><strong>AI Safety and Existential Risk (X-risk):</strong> A significant portion of your listening is dedicated to the potential dangers of advanced AI. You are engaging with experts like Eliezer Yudkowsky and Stephen Wolfram, suggesting you're not just interested in AI's progress, but also its potential risks.</li>
                 <li><strong>The Nature of Intelligence:</strong> You are exploring the very definition of intelligence, as seen in the "Nature of Intelligence" podcast and Joscha Bach's discussion of thoughts. You're seemingly interested in both artificial and natural intelligence.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h2>Supporting Interests</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Politics and Current Affairs:</strong> You're interested in diverse political viewpoints, including those from both the left and right, as seen in TRIGGERnometry, Joe Rogan Experience, Lex Fridman Podcast (Javier Milei), and the Jordan Peterson Podcast. You are not afraid to engage with potentially controversial discussions.</li>
                <li><strong>Technology and Innovation:</strong> Beyond AI, you're drawn to discussions around cutting-edge technology like robotics (Google Deepmind update) and next-generation speech recognition.</li>
                <li><strong>Philosophy and Big Ideas:</strong> There's a thread of interest in philosophical topics, exemplified by discussions around the nature of intelligence, the future of humanity, and secret societies. You seem open to exploring complex and sometimes abstract concepts.</li>
                <li><strong>Gaming (Specific to League of Legends):</strong> Your interest in the "Broken By Concept" podcast shows a more focused interest in a specific game. However this is the only podcast of this kind within the list, indicating a potential break from your dominant interests.</li>
                <li><strong>Economics:</strong> You showed an interest in understanding the economics of Argentina by listening to a podcast with Javier Milei.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h4>Summary of your current interest</h4>
            <p>You are a highly curious and intellectually engaged individual with a strong focus on the rapidly developing field of Artificial Intelligence. You are not just interested in the technological advancements, but also the profound ethical, societal, and philosophical questions that AI raises. You also have a broad interest in current affairs, technology, and philosophical concepts, indicating a desire to understand how everything is connected. You seem to be engaging with complex and sometimes conflicting ideas to formulate your own understanding of the world.</p>
        
            <p><strong>In short, your interests could be summed up as:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AI Enthusiast and Skeptic</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Deep Thinker</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Technologically Curious</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Politically Aware</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Open-Minded</strong></li>
            </ul>
